# Blank Node/Webpack setup for trailing

## Requirements

* Node.js
* Git

## Clone the repo

1. In your terminal, navigate to you development folder.

2. Clone this repo to the selected folder:

`git clone https://github.com/semeon/training-node-webpack.git`


3. Get into the newly created folder:

`cd training-node-webpack`


4. Install NPM packages
`npm install`

5. Start Webpack
`npm run start`

After step 5, webpack will launch the server and compile the code. 
If everything goes fine, you should see the message in your command line:
`ℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.`

Now open your prowser and type `http://localhost:8080`. 
The port number (8080) may be different; look for the port number in the terminal output after step 5 (when the server is just started). It should say something like `ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/`.
